## Anti-Frontrunning Game Contract

This Solidity contract aims to address the problem of frontrunning by implementing a secure mechanism for committing and revealing solutions without exposing oneself to frontrunning risks.

### Contract Features:

- **Solidity Version**: 0.8.0 or higher.
- **Constant Solution Hash**: The contract contains a constant solution hash to ensure solution integrity.
- **Commitment Functionality**: Participants can commit solutions to the contract using the `commit` function.
- **Reveal Functionality**: Participants can reveal their solutions using the `reveal` function, which verifies that the solution matches the constant solution hash and the participant's previous commitment.

### Contract Usage:

1. **Solution Commitment**:
   - Participants commit their solutions by calling the `commit` function with their solution hash as an argument.

2. **Solution Revelation**:
   - Once participants are ready to reveal their solutions, they call the `reveal` function providing the solution as an argument.
   - The function verifies that the solution hash matches the constant solution hash and the participant's previous commitment.

3. **Funds Transfer**:
   - If the revelation is successful and all conditions are met, funds in the contract are automatically transferred to the participant who revealed the solution.

### Solution to Frontrunning Problem:

- By using a constant solution hash and verifying it during revelation, this contract prevents malicious actors from frontrunning solutions.

### Additional Notes:

- It is recommended to thoroughly test the contract in a local development environment before deploying it to a production environment.
- This contract is a basic implementation and may require additional adaptations based on specific use case requirements.
